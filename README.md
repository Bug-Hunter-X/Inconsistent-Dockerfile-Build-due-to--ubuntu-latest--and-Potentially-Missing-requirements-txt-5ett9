# Dockerfile Bug and Solution

This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile issue and its resolution. The initial `Dockerfile` uses `ubuntu:latest`, which can lead to non-deterministic builds and potential dependency issues. The fixed version addresses these problems by specifying a precise image version, handling potential errors, and adding checks for the existence of files.

**Bug:**

The main bug in the original Dockerfile lies in the use of `ubuntu:latest`. This tag is not tied to a specific version, making the build environment inconsistent across runs.  The `apt-get` commands, while seemingly harmless, can also fail due to changes in the base image.  The `pip3 install` assumes a `requirements.txt` file, without any verification.

**Solution:**

The `Dockerfile_fixed` provides a more robust approach, employing a specific Ubuntu version, using a specific python version, and handling errors during installation. It explicitly checks for the existence of `requirements.txt`.
